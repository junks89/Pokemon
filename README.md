# Pokemon

By using the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) create a Pokedex of all existing Pokemon. The App should list all Pokemon and offer the possibility to view Details.
The Details-Page should display:

* picture
* name
* abilities
* type
* order-number
* stats
* possible evolutions
* moves

**Technical constraints:**

* JavaScript Framework: Angular, React or Vue
* Style Framework: any (e.g. Bootstrap or Material), but mandatory
* Typescript
* PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/
* a minimum of 3 meaningful Unit Tests
* 
When done, please upload your app to GitHub and send me the link to the repo via Email. There is no time limit.
